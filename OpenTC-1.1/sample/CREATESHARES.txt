Use the program create to create the shares to tolerate a specified number of faults.
Usage: ./create keysize #faults directory
It will create a threshold sharing with:
n = 3*faults+1
k = faults+1
The call to TC_write_shares which takes a TC_DEALER actually writes the shares to files in a specified directory.  A description of the function is also included in TC.h.

In order for a client to read a share, the function TC_read_share(<filename>) returns a TC_IND individual private key.

In order to get the public key, a call to TC_read_public_key(<filename>) returns  a TC_PK which is the public key for the system.

The read sample program demonstrates reading in the keys and validating them.
